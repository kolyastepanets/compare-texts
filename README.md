## 🎨 Features in Detail

### **Intelligent Difference Detection**
The tool uses a Longest Common Subsequence algorithm to find the optimal alignment between texts, ensuring accurate change detection even when lines are added, removed, or reordered.

### **Line Alignment**
When texts have different numbers of lines, the algorithm intelligently aligns matching lines and highlights insertions/deletions clearly.

### **Character-Level Highlighting**
Not just line differences - the tool highlights exactly which characters changed within each line for precise change tracking.

### **Original Text Preservation**
Your original texts are preserved in read-only fields, allowing you to reference the unmodified versions at any time.
